# General
- documentation (which widgets are where and do what, how-to-plugin, etc.)

# pvid
- one mor infobackend: ExiftoolInfo()
- for Playlist() and play() for omxplayer: kill via dbus after amount of time (length)
- for Playlist() bei omxplayer: wie kommt man da w√§rend der playlist raus?

# plugins.bsto.streamsite
COMPLETELY BROKEN
- Both hosters are nonfunctional at the moment, needs several fixes. 
- Due to captchas on both sites, this will need a mayor update with some sort of interface for that.
- Fails in terminal (interactive or in a script) but works within GTK-GUI
  What the heck is going on?

# plugins.kinox
UNUSABLE
- Same issue with those captchas, but at least everything until youtube-dl works.

# plugins.libs.streamhoster.py
- JDownloader for stubborn hosters. (thanks to youtube-dl low priority)

# Never change:
- No port to GTK3 and python3. Now get of my lawn, kids. 
- I mean, this is github after all, if anybody wants to do it, go for it, i certainly won't.
- Or maybe Qt?
